# DataMiner - Implementation Progress

This file tracks the progress of implementing features for the DataMiner application.

## Implementation Phases
- [x] **Phase 1**: Data handling and basic preprocessing
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Advanced preprocessing and transformation
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Model implementation and evaluation
- [ ] **Phase 4**: UI refinement and user experience optimization

## Feature Implementation Status
