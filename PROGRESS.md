# DataMiner - Implementation Progress

This file tracks the progress of implementing features for the DataMiner application.

## Implementation Phases
- [x] **Phase 1**: Data handling and basic preprocessing
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Advanced preprocessing and transformation
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Model implementation and evaluation
- [ ] **Phase 4**: UI refinement and user experience optimization

## Feature Implementation Status

### Data Handling
- [x] File upload functionality (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- [x] Basic dataset information display
- [x] Interactive data preview with pagination
- [x] Dataset profiling (statistics, distributions, correlations)

### Data Cleaning
- [x] Missing values handling
- [ ] Duplicate entries removal
- [ ] Categorical values conversion
- [x] Missing data pattern visualization

### Data Transformation
- [ ] Min-Max scaling
- [ ] Z-score normalization
- [ ] Decimal scaling
- [ ] Feature selection interface

### Machine Learning Models
#### Classification Models
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Decision Tree
- [ ] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

#### Regression Models
- [ ] Linear Regression

### Model Evaluation & Visualization
- [ ] Classification metrics implementation
